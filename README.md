## Question

### Instructions

You are tasked with creating a very simple single-page web application following the design handed to you.

Nothing that is not explicitly forbidden in these instructions is off the table, and the task is not meant to be strict. If you find yourself having to make a decision, just choose whatever you think benefits you the most.

Take as much time as you need (within reason) and feel free to look around for
solutions. Just be sure you know what you are doing because we are going to try to find out
if you do ;)

As a final note remember that this is more about showcasing your knowledge than
about solving a problem.

### Layout
You have to reproduce the layout and the form controls to the best of your abilities.

Note that it is not required to make the app responsive.

For the purpose of this test you’ll have to refrain from using Bootstrap and similar all-encompasing libraries. Third party templates like HTML5 Boilerplate are also discouraged. Note however that you are allowed of using simpler libraries if you need a css grid.

You can use any CSS preprocessor of choice, and you can also use any edition of
Javascript. If you do, you’ll have to document how should the code be compiled and/or provide the necessary tools if they aren’t available online already (ie. a build shell script).

The icons used in the provided design are:
* fa-bars
* fa-user
* fa-home
* fa-puzzle-piece
* fa-futbol-o
* fa-bicyble
* fa-recycle
* fa-life-ring
* fa-trash-o

### App

This should be the meat of your submission. You are, after all, applying for a job as a full-stack javascript developer. Similarly to the previous instructions, you are discouraged but not forbidden from using frameworks. And as stated before, if your app requires to be built please provide the necessary tools to do so.

It’s okay to reinvent the wheel here, we want to know how well you understand the
wheel.

The app behaviour should be as follows:
* The helpbox must appear closed by default, and should open as an accordion
if the user clicks on it.
* Both the form and the list should be visible at all times.
* When a form field is focused, instructions should appear below it. Any text is
fine, you can go with “Lorem ipsu...”.
* The list should be pre-populated with data. The data may or may not be the
same one that is displayed on the PDF. Just a couple of rows are fine.
* The “trash” icon should only appear when the user is hovering over the row.
Clicking on it should remove the row.
* Submitting the form should add a new row to the list.
* It is not required to persist the data in the list.
